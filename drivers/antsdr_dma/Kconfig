	  Driver for ANTSDR DMA to UDP streaming functionality.
	  
	  This driver provides a character device interface for streaming
	  data from FPGA via Xilinx AXI DMA to PC over UDP. It supports 
	  interrupt-based transfers and automatic UDP packet transmission.
	  
	  Requires Xilinx AXI DMA IP core in the FPGA design.
	  
	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called antsdr_dma.

	  Driver for ANTSDR DMA to UDP streaming functionality using direct
	  register access instead of the DMA engine framework.
	  
	  This driver provides a character device interface for streaming
	  data from FPGA via Xilinx AXI DMA to PC over UDP. It uses direct
	  register access for maximum control and performance.
	  
	  Requires Xilinx AXI DMA IP core in the FPGA design.
	  
	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called antsdr_dma_direct.
